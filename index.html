    <h1>WA üì¨</h1>

    <p>This is the <em>Week Ahead (WA)</em> format email I've been sending out for the past 6 months, every Sunday night.</p>

    <h3>The goal is simple: we all have close friends that we want to stay in sync with and friendly acquaintances we want to bring more into the fold.</h3>

    <p>At first this was driven by the thought that offline 1v1s should really be accelerants to discuss something deeper and wider....with the appropriate context. We <em>waste</em> so much coffee time catching up and asking questions any twitter follower could. And I can barely piece together someone's mental and emotional state via check-ins, professional tweets, 20 secs of snapchat, etc.</p>

    <p>Why couldn't I just stay in sync with the 5, 10 or 20 parallel lives that I care about most?</p>

    <p><em>We're all waking up to go to the gym, headed to work, back for event/hang...but most importantly - what's in each of our minds and hearts.</em></p>
    <p><em>What are they thinking and scheming, what are they going through, how can I be of help, how can I be excited for them...and vice versa.</em></p>

    <p>So a few months ago, a small cohort just started sending these regular updates (mostly forward looking, lot more candid and genuine that any social media post, life+work) and the result has been pretty incredible.</p>

    <p>Here's a quick note I sent a friend asking why I did this as he didn't quite get it at first...especially as he saw me in various social feeds.</p>

  <div class="mx-auto container px2 py1 bg-tan mb4 shadow">
    <header class="border-top border-bottom mt2 container mx-auto">
      <p class="mt2 code">Subject: what is the week ahead<p>
      <p class="code">From: ryandawidjan@gmail.com</p>
      <p class="code">To: </p>
    </header>

    <ul class="pl2">
      <li class="mb2">We feel in sync. I could go two months without seeing my best friend due to life/travel/work stress but still be interacting with meaningful context. <em>Good luck on those dates! Oh, you're in town that weekend - let's hang. How did the new product pitch go? Now you're into yoga now, want to go together? How's your aunt's health condition progressed?</em></li>
      <li class="mb2">It makes us all stop and check ourselves on Sunday nights so we don't blindly enter into a Monday am work week that we don't want or don't understand. Great way to quickly reflect on last week as well.</li>
      <li class="mb2">If you bring in acquaintances and connections that you trust but haven't gotten drunk with/shared many meals with/hung out 1v1 - the candid nature and realness of the string of updates helps bring you two closer. It's like oh, <em>here's what Ryan is doing that's not Insta+Twitter.</em></li>
      <li class="mb2">Accountability: I don't think it's as rigid and structured as some folks potentially envisioned..not something to do with a mentor or high level role model. I do think there is a significant level of self discipline and reinforcement that's brought about by this...because you know people are bound to ask you for an update on the matter.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As a comparable...think about how much context and awareness foursquare check-ins bring to a close knit tribe. I can reasonably discern travel, new experiences, dates, taking recommendations, fitness, etc...the Week Ahead is trying to bring that ambient awareness to thoughts, feelings and plans.</p>

    <p class="mt1 mb1">------</p>

    <p>This is not a product, company or social experiment. It's simply been an enjoyable, immensely valuable and exciting weekly experience that I wanted to share with you...the fav'rs of <a href="https://twitter.com/ryandawidjan/status/709185937335590913">this tweet</a> are exactly the people who could find this worthwhile. </p>

    <p>Each week friends of mine start transitioning from recipients to writers and the Monday inbox just becomes that much better. I'd be more than happy to be your first recipient :)</p>

    <p>It's simple. with no formal rules, just some inspired structure.</p>

    <ul class="pl2">
      <li class="">A few personal notes, few professional notes.</li>
      <li class="">Be candid and real.</li>
      <li class="">Mix of recap and future looking.</li>
      <li class="">Not an email newsletter.</li>
      <li class="">Candid enough to warrant folks not feeling comfortable forwarding.</li>
      <li class="">Sunday night sends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notes from 6 months of writing üí≠</h3>
      <ul class="pl2 mb4">
        <li class="mb1">It's an awesome mental exercise to pull up last week's WA as you construct your current one...simple but refreshing and helpful way remind yourself of what you just were up to and if there are any ongoing trends that need to continue or stop.</li>
        <li class="mb1">The first WA is always the toughest. It's a fun question to ask yourself, <em>what 3-5-10 friends are really my true friends...individuals that I don't have to ask permission to email and who would appreciate this insight into my life.</em></li>
        <li class="mb1">Add as many people as you like. Most friends have started with 3-5 bcc'd recipients. Keep adding friends, family members and trusted acquaintances up until the point where by adding someone, you know that you would start editing your writing...mistakes, aspirations, observations and thoughts should be fair game for this inner circle.</li>
        <li class="mb1">It definitely takes 2-3 WA sessions to have it click in single player mode...the reflection, taking stock of your life and hearing yourself think will become addictive (in a good way).</li>
        <li class="mb1">Find your cadence. every week ‚Üí popular, every other week is good too. 1x a month can turn into a chore or too curated of a recap.</li>
        <li class="mb1">Sometimes there are people who have similar DNA and interests as you....who you become digitally friendly (calls, emails, tweets) with....but you haven't met yet because you happen to live in two different cities...sometimes the WA is the best way to level up that relationship.</li>
        <li class="mb1">Ever feel compelled to grab drinks and catch up with a friend when you're visiting in their city? Natural and good feeling. But why do we need to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù when each of us is on our phone or computer 12hrs a day? Just send 10 sentences each week and you'll feel like connected best buds year around. That rare coffee, beer or dinner should go in deep, funny, creative, vulnerable, random directions...not ‚Äúhow's life‚Äù, ‚Äúhow's everything?‚Äù, ‚Äúyou like your job?‚Äù and ‚Äúseeing anyone?‚Äù</li>
        <li class="mb1">Once you start receiving WAs from close friends, you'll start to realize seeing their snaps, reading their tweets and liking their FB photos almost becomes icing on the cake...maybe even optional. Their curated and select social media is really rooted in the 5-10 bullet points they share you with on Sunday nights.</li>
        <li class="mb1">No one is too close to not receive a WA from. You will be completely surprised by just how much more there is tolearn about and listen to from your roommate, best friend and significant other.</li>
        <li class="mb1">Some people like to start counting weeks at the bottom of their note. #Week1..#Week2..etc helps slow down life a bit.</li>
        <li class="mb1">Similar format to the WA to explore. <a href="https://t.co/6YSmb67fEx">The Elephants</a>. <a href="https://t.co/7UO3MhzKku">Five Things I've Learned Since Becoming an Elephant</a></li>
        <li class="mb1">If you want a social out and simple description, the bit below has worked well.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="dashed mt3 px2 mb4">
        <h3 class="mt2">Description to potentially include:</h3>
        <p><em>What is this email?</em></p>

        <p><em>A Week Ahead email is something a few close friends and I have been experimenting with the past few weeks. Great way to stay connected, potentially be helpful and just have a nice awareness of what one is doing or thinking about if you didn't grab coffee or read a few tweets. </em></p>

        <p><em>Think of it as a quick, intimate and fun stand up amongst your inner circle.</em></p>

        <p><em>It's kinda like seltzer...you gotta try it twice before you realize it's awesome.</em></p>
